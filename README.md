## About me
I am a **Product, Program**, and **Digital Marketing Manager** who loves solving complex problems to make customers' lives easier and help brands scale their business. 

I have 15 years of experience in Product and Program Management at **Microsoft**, where I optimized and built new [**MSN channels**](https://www.msn.com) and [**Bing Apps**](https://www.bing.com) - with a focus on user **growth, retention, monetization and international expansion**. 

Before that, I led the **Digital Marketing and CRM program** at **VisitBritain** in Spain, promoting Great Britain as a tourist destination and cross-selling trip-related products - from flights to Oyster cards and theatre tickets.

Earlier in my career, I spent 5 years in **business development** at [**Austrade**](https://www.austrade.gov.au/), helping Australian companies export to Spain and Portugal (from seafood and wines - yes wine *to* Spain :smile: -, to swags and surfboards). 

I am lifelong learner, which has continuously driven me to explore new roles and responsibilities. I hold a **Bachelor of Arts in English** from University of Salamanca, and I'm currently studying a Master's in **Cloud Computing and AI** at Complutense University of Madrid. Over the past decade, I've also completed programs in **Innovation Management, Programmatic Advertising, CRM** and **Digital Marketing**.

In my free time, I love discovering new countries, going to live music concerts, and enjoying tapas with my family and friends.

## Increasing MSN Advertising Revenue 4X :heavy_dollar_sign::rocket:

One of my projects at **Microsoft** was to lead the **revenue strategy execution for MSN** across 53 international markets. The goal was to **quadruple advertising revenue** while maintaining user engagement and growth rates.

**MSN** is Microsoft’s **news and media aggregator service**, offering personalized news curated by both human editors and AI. It partners with over 1,000 premium publishers globally and is monetized through **credible, appropriate, and discreet advertising**.

### **The Challenge**

When I joined the team, MSN had over **600 million Daily Active Users (DAU)** worldwide. However, international revenue significantly lagged behind U.S. benchmarks and relied solely on **programmatic display ads** with no consistent premium inventory strategy.

### **My Role**

My first task was to **implement and validate the correct instrumentation of Ads PGCs (page group codes)** after the migration to a new content platform.

It soon became clear we needed to diversify revenue streams, explore new ad formats, and experiment with partners to validate potential — all while maintaining product quality.

After conducting market research and identifying potential partners, we designed a **four-pronged strategy** to increase contribution margin by 4x:

  1. **Optimize existing Programmatic display ads revenue**.
  2. **Introduce Native Advertisers** without degrading the user experience.
  3. **Integrate Affiliate links** within lifestyle and "shopping"-related content.
  4. **Enable direct-sold demand** in Tier 1 markets (top 15 by traffic and revenue). 

To operationalize this, I created a **virtual global team (v-team)** including a **PM** and a **Business Development Manager** from each region (APAC, EMEA, North America, LATAM).
	- Regional reps identified partnership opportunities and regional monetization improvements.
	- PMs managed local roadmaps, while I owned the **global prioritization and execution**.

I managed the **International Monetization Epic** in **Azure DevOps**, tracking progress on prioritized **Features** and **PBIs** across revenue streams.

I worked closely with the Platform team to define the **Ads Share of Voice (SOV)** (ad density) to ensure monetization never compromised the user experience. Every new ad placement or partner integration was **A/B tested** and validated through experimentation.

**Key initiatives** included:

- Leading the experimentation and onboarding of **native ad partners (Taboola, Outbrain, and 13 regional partners)**.
- Managing **programmatic display partners** and feature optimizations to improve inventory quality.
- Creating the **Direct Sold Demand Playbook** to help top markets sell premium placements.
- Testing and deploying **affiliate links** in shopping-related content.

### I measured the following **key metrics**:

- **Product Guardrail Metrics (Audience & Inventory Health)**:
  - :white_check_mark: Avg. Daily Active Users (DAU)
  - :white_check_mark: Core Page Views (CPVs)
  - :white_check_mark: CPV/UU (Core Page Views per Unique User) - an indicator of product quality and inventory health

- **Monetization Guardrail Metrics**:
  - :white_check_mark: NPS (Net Promoter Score) - ensuring monetization didn't hurt user value
  - :white_check_mark: Promotion Density - % of user surface with ads
  - :white_check_mark: CTR (Click-Through Rate) - engagement and ad quality signal
  - :white_check_mark: Viewability Rate - % of ad impressions meeting MRC standards 
	
- **Revenue (Yield) Metrics**:
  - :white_check_mark: eCPM / RPM - revenue per thousand impressions
  - :white_check_mark: Fill Rate - % of impressions filled
  - :white_check_mark: ARPU - Average Revenue per User.
  - :white_check_mark: CM/GM - contribution margin and gross margin

### **The Results** :chart_with_upwards_trend:

- **4x increase** in international advertising revenue in 4 years
- Achieved **+100% year-over-year growth** while maintaining product quality and user engagement
