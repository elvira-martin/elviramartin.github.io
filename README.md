## Increasing MSN advertising revenue X4

One of my projects while working at **Microsoft** was to lead the **revenue strategy execution for MSN**.  

MSN is Microsoft's **news and media aggregator service**. It provides personalized news content based on user interests, curated by both human editors and AI, and partners with over 1,000 premium publishers globally. As a free experience for users, it is monetized through **credible, appropriate, and discrete advertising**.  

I was responsible for the **monetization strategy across 53 international markets**, with the goal to **increase advertising revenue X4** while maintaining the platform's **user engagement and growth rates**. When I joined the team, MSN had over **600 million Daily Active Users (DAU)**, and the only advertising revenue source was **Display Programmatic Ads**.

### Strategy to Achieve Revenue Goal

To achieve the X4 revenue goal, we needed to **experiment with new online advertising revenue streams**, identify potential partners, and validate their revenue potential while maintaining **product quality**.  

After market research and partner identification, we focused on a **4-pronged approach** to multiply contribution margin:

1. **Optimize existing Programmatic Display Ads revenue**.  
2. **Introduce Native Advertisers** without degrading user experience.  
3. **Introduce Affiliates** in lifestyle / "shopping" related content.  
4. **Introduce Direct Demand Sold placements** in Tier 1 markets (top 15 markets by traffic and revenue).

### Metrics Tracked

### 1. Product Guardrail Metrics (Audience & Inventory Health)
Ensure a healthy audience and high-quality inventory for monetization.

- **Avg Daily Active Users (DAU)**  
- **Core PVS (Core Page Views)**  
- **CPV/UU (Core Page Views per Unique User)**  
  *Measures overall product quality and helps maintain quality inventory to help partners sell.*

### 2. Leading Monetization Guardrail Metrics
Predictive signals to balance monetization and user experience.

- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** – Ensures monetization does not degrade user value.  
- **Promotion Density** – % of user surface where ads appear.  
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** – Ad engagement signal and predictor of revenue performance.  
- **Viewability Rate** – % of ad impressions meeting MRC viewability standards.  

### 3. Revenue / Yield Metrics
Measure monetization efficiency and profitability.

- **eCPM / RPM** – Revenue per thousand impressions; indicates market demand and pricing strength.  
- **Fill Rate** – % of ad inventory actually filled.  
- **ARPU (Average Revenue per Active User)** – User-level monetization metric.  
- **CM / GM (Contribution / Gross Margin)** – Profitability after variable or total costs.  
- **Total Ad Revenue** – Overall advertising revenue generated.
