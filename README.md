## Increasing MSN Advertising Revenue X4

One of my projects while working at **Microsoft** was to lead the **revenue strategy execution for MSN**.  

MSN is Microsoft's **news and media aggregator service**. It provides personalized news content based on user interests, curated by both human editors and AI, and partners with over 1,000 premium publishers globally. As a free experience for users, it is monetized through **credible, appropriate, and discrete advertising**.  

**The Objective**

I was responsible for the **monetization strategy across 53 international markets**, with the goal to **increase advertising revenue X4** while maintaining the platform's **user engagement and growth rates**. When I joined the team, MSN had over **600 million Daily Active Users (DAU)**, and the only advertising revenue source was **Display Programmatic Ads**.

**The Strategy** to Achieve the Revenue Goal

To achieve the X4 revenue goal, we needed to **experiment with new online advertising revenue streams**, identify potential partners, and validate their revenue potential while maintaining **product quality**.  

After market research and identification of partners, we focused on a **4-pronged approach** to multiply contribution margin:

> 1. **Optimize existing Programmatic Display Ads revenue**.  
> 2. **Introduce Native Advertisers** without degrading the user experience.  
> 3. **Introduce Affiliates** in lifestyle / "shopping" related content.  
> 4. **Introduce Direct Demand Sold placements** in Tier 1 markets (top 15 markets by traffic and revenue).

We tracked the **following metrics**:

   - Product Guardrail metrics (**Audience & Inventory health**):
     - Avg Daily Active Users
     - Core PVS: Core Page Views
     - CPV/UU: Core Page Views per Unique User (this metric measure overall product quality and health, and helps us have quality invertory to help our partners sell).
     
   - **Leading Monetization** Guardrail Metrics:
     - NPS (Net Promoter Score): to ensure that monetization does not destroy user value.
     - Promotion Density: the percentage of user surface where ads appear.
     - CTR (Click-Through Rate): ad engament is a signal of ad quality and predicts revenue performance.
     - Viewability Rate: %of ad impressions that meet the MRC viewability.
     
   -  **Revenue (Yield)** metrics:
      - eCPM / RPM: $ revenue per mille (thousand) impressions. It is an indicator of monetization efficiency (market demand and pricing strength).
      - Fill rate: percentage of actual ad impressions filled with an ad.
      - ARPU: Average Revenue per Active User.
      - CM/GM: profitability after variable (CM) or total (GM) costs.
      - Total Ad revenue.
