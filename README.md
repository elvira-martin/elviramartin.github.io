## About me
I am a **Product, Program**, and **Digital Marketing Manager** who loves solving complex problems to make customers' lives easier and help brands scale their business. 

I have 15 years of experience in Product and Program Management at **Microsoft**, where I optimized and built new [**MSN channels**](https://www.msn.com) and [**Bing Apps**](https://www.bing.com) - with a focus on user **growth, retention, monetization and international expansion**. 

Before that, I led the **Digital Marketing and CRM program** at **VisitBritain** in Spain, promoting Great Britain as a tourist destination and cross-selling trip-related products - from flights to Oyster cards and theatre tickets.

Earlier in my career, I spent 5 years in **business development** at [**Austrade**](https://www.austrade.gov.au/), helping Australian companies export to Spain and Portugal (from seafood and wines - yes wine *to* Spain :smile: -, to swags and surfboards). 

I am lifelong learner, which has continuously driven me to explore new roles and responsibilities. I hold a **Bachelor of Arts in English** from University of Salamaaca, and I'm currently studying a Master's in **Cloud Computing and AI** at Complutense University of Madrid. Over the past decade, I've also completed programs in **Innovation Management, Programmatic Advertising, CRM** and **Digital Marketing**.

In my free time, I love discovering new countries, going to live music concerts, and enjoying tapas with my family and friends.

## Increasing MSN Advertising Revenue X4 :heavy_dollar_sign::rocket:

One of my projects while working at **Microsoft** was to lead the **revenue strategy execution for MSN** across 53 international markets. The goal was to increase x4 the advertising revenue, while maintaining the platform's  user engagement and growth rates.  

MSN is Microsoft's **news and media aggregator service**. It provides personalized news content based on user interests, curated by both human editors and AI, and partners with over 1,000 premium publishers globally. As a free experience for users, it is monetized through **credible, appropriate, and discrete advertising**.

**The Challenge**

When I joined the team, MSN had over 600 million Daily Active Users (DAU) globally and the only advertising revenue source was through **Display Programmatic Ads**. 

Revenue from international markets lagged behind U.S. benchmarks and lacked a consistent strategy for premium ad inventory.

**My Role**

I defined a unified revenue growth framework; partnered with engineering, international PMs, BizDev and ad sales to align on vision and plans. To achieve the X4 revenue goal, we needed to **experiment with new online advertising revenue streams**, identify potential partners, and validate their revenue potential while maintaining **product quality**.  

After market research and identification of partners, we focused on a **4-pronged approach** to multiply contribution margin:

> 1. [**Optimization of existing Programmatic Display Ads revenue**.](https://github.com/elvira-martin/programmatic-display)  
> 2. [**Introduction of Native Advertisers**](https://github.com/elvira-martin/native-advertising) without degrading the user experience.  
> 3. **Introduction of Affiliates** in lifestyle / "shopping" related content.  
> 4. **Introduction of a Direct Demand Sold program** in Tier 1 markets (top 15 markets by traffic and revenue).

We tracked the **following metrics**:

   - Product Guardrail metrics (**Audience & Inventory health**):
     - :white_check_mark: Avg Daily Active Users
     - :white_check_mark: Core PVS: Core Page Views
     - :white_check_mark: CPV/UU: Core Page Views per Unique User (this metric measure overall product quality and health, and helps us have quality invertory to help our partners sell).
     
   - **Leading Monetization** Guardrail Metrics:
     - :white_check_mark: NPS (Net Promoter Score): to ensure that monetization does not destroy user value.
     - :white_check_mark: Promotion Density: the percentage of user surface where ads appear.
     - :white_check_mark: CTR (Click-Through Rate): ad engament is a signal of ad quality and predicts revenue performance.
     - :white_check_mark: Viewability Rate: %of ad impressions that meet the MRC viewability.
     
   -  **Revenue (Yield)** metrics:
      - :white_check_mark: eCPM / RPM: $ revenue per mille (thousand) impressions. It is an indicator of monetization efficiency (market demand and pricing strength).
      - :white_check_mark: Fill rate: percentage of actual ad impressions filled with an ad.
      - :white_check_mark: ARPU: Average Revenue per Active User.
      - :white_check_mark: CM/GM: profitability after variable (CM) or total (GM) costs.
      - :white_check_mark: Total Ad revenue.
